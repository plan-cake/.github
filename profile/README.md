# Plancake

[Plancake](https://plancake.org/) is a scheduling website that solves the logistics problem of figuring out when everyone is available to meet. Our goal was to simplify the process of communication with a simple and intuitive interface, where one person sends out a link to potential meeting times, and compiles the possible meeting times according to everyoneâ€™s availability.

The creation of this application was inspired by scheduling sites like [whenisgood](https://whenisgood.net/) and [when2meet](https://www.when2meet.com/) (except this one aims to provide a better user experience for users on both mobile and desktop devices).

## Usage

To use the application, just go to **https://plancake.org/** and start scheduling!
